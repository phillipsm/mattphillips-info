                <p class="desc-title">About</p>
				<p>
					Working in Widener is an educational game. You assume the role of a shelver working in Harvard's Widener Library. You are assigned five books to shelve and asked to find their places in the stacks using their call numbers. The faster the better.
				</p>
				<p>
				    One of the best things about Working in Widener is that it can be a two-player game. You can compete, in realtime, against a friend.
				</p>
                <p class="desc-title">Technology</p>
				<p>
					Working in Widener was a lot of fun to build. It's mostly written in JavaScript and leverages the Node.js and Socket.io technologies. A big thanks to those folks for building a sharing.
				</p>
                <p class="desc-title">Collaboration</p>
