                <p class="desc-title">pyfav is simple, and simple to use</p>
                <p>The easiest way to get started is to use the download_favicon function,</p>
<pre>
from pyfav import download_favicon

favicon_saved_at = download_favicon('https://www.python.org/')
</pre>
                <p>You should now see the favicon in your /tmp directory. If you want to control where the favicon gets written to disk,</p>
<pre>
from pyfav import download_favicon
import os

os.mkdir('/tmp/favicon-downloads')

favicon_saved_at = download_favicon('https://www.python.org/', \
file_prefix='python.org-', target_dir='/tmp/favicon-downloads')
</pre>
                <p class="desc-title">Get the location</p>
                <p>If you’d prefer to only get the location of the favicon, use the get_favicon_url function,</p>
<pre>
from pyfav import download_favicon

favicon_url = get_favicon_url('https://www.python.org/')
</pre>
                <p class="desc-title">Install</p>
                <p>The easiest to get pyfav is through PIP</p>
<pre>
pip install pyfav

				<p>
					Favicons are the small icons that show up in a web browser's tab when you navigate to a page.
				</p>
				<p>
				    They can be annoying to programmatically retrieve because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Browser_implementation" target="_blank">they’re commonly located in a handful of different places</a>. pyfav is a Python library that removes the annoyance by handling the details for you – you supply a URL and pyfav will give you the favicon.
				</p>
                <p class="desc-title">What's so great about a favicon?</p>
				<p>
					Favicons are fascinating because of the tight constraint they enforce. They ask an organization to represent their identity in one 16 pixel by 16 pixel image.</p>
                <p>
                    This constraint surfaces things about the organization. Do they value their logo over a more abstract representation? Maybe the first letter of their organization's name is most important. What colors do they use to represent themselves? This scarcity of space can be revealing.
